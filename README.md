# 🚀 BridgeLabz Training – OOPS C# Practice

This repository contains my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) based C# practice work** completed during the **BridgeLabz Training Program**.  
It builds upon the strong **Core C# foundation** developed earlier and focuses on **classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, and real-world scenarios**.

---

## 🏫 Training Overview

- **Training Program:** BridgeLabz – .NET Training  
- **Assigned Technology:** C# / .NET  
- **Training Start Date:** **16 December 2024**  
- **Mode:** Hands-on coding + scenario-based learning  

---

## 📌 Branch Context & Background

> 🔹 **16 December – 30 December 2025**  
> All **Core C# concepts** (basics, control flow, arrays, strings, methods, extras, and scenario-based logic) were implemented in the  
> **`core-csharp-practice` branch**.

> 🔹 **From 31 December 2025 onwards**, this new branch  
> **`oops-csharp-practice`**  
> is dedicated exclusively to:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Class-based design
- Real-world system modeling
- Scenario-driven applications using OOPS

This README continues the **training timeline seamlessly**, while clearly separating **Core C#** and **OOPS C#** work.

The focus of this day was:
- Understanding **classes & objects**
- Constructor usage
- Fields & methods
- Method-driven logic
- User interaction via console
- Clean and readable OOPS structure

---

### 📁 Folder Structure Used
oops-csharp-practice/scenario-based

Each file represents a **standalone real-world scenario**, implemented using **proper OOPS principles**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Strengthened

- Class & object creation
- Constructors with parameters
- Instance variables (fields)
